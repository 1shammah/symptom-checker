# Your proposal mentions:
# 
# Symptom frequency
# Disease prevalence
# Severity distribution
# Correlations
# 
# These donâ€™t live in the DB, they live in Pandas.
# 
# So AnalyticsModel is where you:
# 
# Load data (from DB or CSV)
# Run aggregations
# Return plots, stats, summaries
# 
# Use this model only for the Analytics View/Page
# 
# Functions might include:
# 
# get_symptom_frequency()
# get_most_common_diseases()
# get_average_severity_per_symptom()
# get_symptom_correlation_matrix() (Optional with SciPy)

# ANALYTICS MODEL
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This model provides static analytics and statistical insights
# based on preloaded datasets only. It avoids tracking real-time
# user activity to maintain privacy and comply with ethical
# research constraints (e.g. Worktribe clearance not required).

# Current features include:
# - Symptom frequency analysis across diseases
# - Symptom severity distribution (from symptom_severity.csv)
# - Symptom co-occurrence patterns (e.g., common pairs)
# - Disease coverage insights (e.g., number of symptoms or precautions per disease)

# The model uses preprocessed data already stored in the SQLite DB
# via `database.py` and does NOT rely on user interaction logs.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# FUTURE EXTENSIONS (if user history is later enabled):
# - Track most commonly selected symptoms in symptom checks
# - Identify most frequently predicted diseases
# - Analyse user roles, login frequency, and interaction volume
# - Timeline-based analytics (e.g., symptom trends over time)

# These features would rely on the `symptom_checks` table, which
# is already in place but currently unused.
# ------------------------------------------------------------

#logic for analytical summaries and insights
# uses helper methods in db for counting users, symptoms and disesases
# provides data for admin dashnoards or reporting 
# can be extended with visualiasation, charts or advanced insights


# logic for static analytics based on preloaded datasets
# operates on diseases, symptoms, severity and relationships
# does not use user symptom history due to ethical restrictions
# supports insights like common dieases, symptoms and severity distributions
# intended for use by admins in dashboard visualiastations
# uses pandas for data manipulation and analysis
